====== ABOUT =======
8Tracks (http://8tracks.com) is by far the best music site I've ever used! The site UI is brilliant, the people are superb, and the music is awesomeness
8Tracks in internet radio, so ideally you're **NOT** sposed to be able to download songs from the site!
Thankfully though, it is very easy to get music from the site.

This is a simple Playlist downloader for 8Tracks
<strike> Simply change the $playlist variable in index.php and run the file... It downloads the entire playlist to the "songs" folder</strike>

Hack developed overnight using PHP+CURL+XAMPP and while listening to The Awkward Moment when the Remix is better than the Original... (http://8tracks.com/awhit10/the-awkward-moment-when-the-remix-is-better-than-the-original) :) :)

UPDATE:
Added a UI (?). All you have to do is input playlist URL in homepage and click download! :)
Here's a peek at the simplified UI: http://brizzly.com/pic/4S3U 

UPDATE 2:
8Tracks used to provide 64K m4a (still does infact), though their primary server now encodes into 48K ...This provides smaller filesize, but less quality. So have added support for 64K encoded downloads.
Updated UI: http://brizzly.com/pic/4S4Q (Just check HIGH QUALITY to download 64K m4a's)
Maintaining 64K encoding works out pretty costly for the 8Tracks team ( http://groups.google.com/group/8tracks-public-api/browse_thread/thread/14da42858b928b88# ) so I don't know how long they'll support it for! But while they do, enjoy! :)
